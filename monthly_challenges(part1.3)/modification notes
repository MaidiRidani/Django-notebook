# also add in challenges/urls.py

# now imagine if we create many months or something that exceeds our capacity â€” this will become inefficient.
# so what if we make it a bit more dynamic by relying on user input?

# changes in challenges/views.py
def monthly_challenge(request, month):
    challenge_text = None
    if month == 'january':
        challenge_text = "Eat something like fruit"
    elif month == 'february':
        challenge_text = "Don't eat this day"
    elif month == 'march':
        challenge_text = "Eat briefly today"
    else:
        return HttpResponseNotFound("Month not valid")
    return HttpResponse(challenge_text)

# also add this in challenges/urls.py
urlpatterns = [
    path("<month>", views.monthly_challenge),
]

# this way, it's a bit more dynamic, because the input /challenges/<month> is captured
# and used in if-else conditions. This is better than the static approach before.
